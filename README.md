# Modelling flow across the aortic valve using finite elements and static Navier Stokes

I developed this project as part of my Advanced Finite Element Analysis module during my BEng degree, it is entirely based on MATLAB and it studies the pressure drop across the aortic valve in presence of aortic stenosis. Below is the abstract of the submitted report/paper.

**Abstract**<br>
Aortic Stenosis is the most common heart valvular disease and affects roughly 2% of the elderly population. Treatment of severe cases involves surgical replacement of the Aortic Tricuspid Valve with prosthetic ones, which often lead to complications due to unaccounted blood flow through the valve. To ensure correct blood flow, such pros- thetic valves must be meticulously designed, this is done through com- putational flow simulations to gain insights on the velocity and pres- sure distributions through the aortic valve along with the stresses they produce on the artificial leaflets. To this end, a FEM routine was devel- oped to solve a static, incompressible-flow simplification of Navier Stokesâ€™ equations coupled with Continuity equation, approximating the pressure and velocity fields throughout an idealized, axisymmetric 2D projection of the aortic sinus and downstream Aorta. The number of assumptions taken through this paper are excessively large to have any clinical pur- pose and the scope of this work is merely to analyze the computational approach adopted to solve such problems and its accuracy.
